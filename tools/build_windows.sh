# Builds the desktop program for Windows x64 with clang-cl: tools/recompile.sh, then the game (CMakeLists.txt) into
# build/windows/PerfectDarkRecompiled.exe, beside the DLLs it needs (SDL2, dxcompiler, dxil). Run tools/build_decomp.sh
# first, in WSL2 on the same checkout, which makes the relink the code is recompiled from (docs/building.md, Windows).
# From Git Bash, anywhere in the checkout:
#
#     tools/build_windows.sh [cpus]
#
# On PATH: clang-cl and lld-link, CMake 3.20-3.31 and Ninja, and wsl, whose default distro has clang, ld.lld and make
# for patches/ (CMakeLists.txt, PATCHES_MAKE). Without WSL, set MIPS_CC to a Windows clang with a MIPS backend (MSYS2's
# clang64 has one) and MIPS_LD to an ld.lld, with GNU make on PATH: patches/ builds with those instead. clang-cl finds
# the MSVC libraries and the Windows SDK by itself where Visual Studio or its Build Tools are installed, or else from
# INCLUDE and LIB.

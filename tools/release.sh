# Builds the desktop program's release, for Windows and for Linux, and publishes both as one GitHub release. CI has no
# ROM (none is ever uploaded), so it can't build the game; a release is built where the ROM is, after
# tools/build_decomp.sh, and holds nothing from it: the player picks theirs with Load ROM, as on the page.
#
#     tools/release.sh windows   # Git Bash on Windows, as tools/build_windows.sh says: out/<name>-windows-x64.zip
#     tools/release.sh linux     # Linux with Docker: out/<name>-linux-x64.tar.gz
#     tools/release.sh publish   # both archives, built from this commit: the GitHub release (gh signed in)
#
# The tag is v<version_string> from src/main.cpp, so bump that first, and write the release's notes beside it in
# releases/v<version>.md: what a player gets, not a list of merged PRs. Both builds and the publish run on the same
# commit, origin/main's, with a clean tree: each archive records the commit it was built from (out/<archive>.commit),
# and publish refuses archives from another one, a tree with changes, or a tag that exists.
#
# Windows: tools/build_windows.sh's program, packed by tools/package_windows.sh (the DLLs, assets/,
# recompcontrollerdb.txt and LICENSE beside the exe). It needs the Visual C++ 2015-2022 redistributable (x64).
# Linux: tools/build_linux.sh's program, built in tools/docker/Dockerfile.linux, Ubuntu 22.04, so it needs glibc 2.35
# or newer, with its debug info stripped. It carries the libSDL2 it was built with and libatomic (not on every system)
# beside the binary (RUNPATH $ORIGIN), as the Windows zip carries SDL2.dll, and is a .tar.gz so the binary stays
# executable. GTK 3, FreeType and a Vulkan driver are the system's. Run from another folder, the program works from its
# own (src/main.cpp).
# v0.1.0's Linux archive was checked by running it in distribution containers under Xvfb with Mesa's software Vulkan
# (lavapipe), from another folder, the ROM stored beside it, --boot: on Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 12 it played the intro
# for 3 minutes; on Ubuntu 24.04 (Mesa 25.2) it drew the title and then lavapipe crashed in one of its own llvmpipe
# threads, as rush-2049-recomp's release does there. No Linux GPU has run it.

// The survey: lets a script start any solo mission by itself, keep the player alive in it and end it completed, for
// the page's shader list (src/rt64_shaders.txt, recorded by tools/shader_plan.json) and its play plans
// (tools/play_plan.json, tools/play_plan_full.json), without anyone playing the menus. It does nothing unless a script
// asks.
//
// The script (tools/shader_survey.js) finds this struct in RDRAM by its two magic words. `newfile` set at the file
// menu makes an Agent file and saves it to the Game Pak as New Agent's name and location do (gamefile_load_defaults,
// then filemgr_save_game_to_device's save), taken once the menu has read the Game Pak, has room on it and the pak
// answers to its serial (before that the save fails without trying), so the game has a file to save each mission's
// end to, as a player's has; `newfileresult` is then 1 if it saved, -1 if not, and `pakerror` the save's error
// (g_FilemgrLastPakError). It writes the stage's index in the mission list (g_SoloStages, 0 is dataDyne Central - Defection) into `stageindex` and then `request`; `loaded`
// counts the requests taken, so it knows one was, and `target` is the stage the last one started. main_tick
// (patches/frame_rate.c) calls shader_survey_tick once a frame on the game's main thread, so a request is taken between
// frames: the mission is set up on Agent, alone, and started as mission select's Accept does
// (menuhandler_accept_mission), the game's own way into a level. `invincible` set keeps
// every player alive as the Invincible cheat does. `complete` set ends the mission in a level as its own script does
// when the player has done what it asks (func0000e990, ai_end_level's: the objectives checked, then the stage ended),
// with every objective counted complete (debug_force_all_objectives_complete, the debug build's switch, below) until
// the next mission starts: the endscreen says Mission Completed, the file records it and Continue goes on to the next
// mission, as after a player's. `completed` counts the ends taken. Every frame the struct also carries the stage
// playing, how many stages have started (`loads`: the title's intro plays in Defection's stage, so the stage alone
// doesn't say a request started it), whether the player is in control (`incontrol`: in a level, its own view, no
// cutscene) and the level's clock (g_Vars.lvframe240, 240 a second of the game's own time), which the plans hold
// their waits on. A request taken during the title's intro is lost: the title goes on to the file menu (stage
// STAGE_CITRAINING), where a script asks.

// The game's own frame rate, told to RT64.
//
// The main loop ticks at most once a retrace (g_Vars.mininc60, 1 in every build) and each tick advances the game by
// the time it took, counted in 1/60 s and 1/240 s (frametime_calculate, src/game/timing.c): on a console Perfect Dark
// draws at 15-30 a second, here at 60 where the host keeps up. RT64 interpolates to the display's rate from the rate a
// frame says it was made at (gEXSetRefreshRate), as GoldenEye's recompilation does, so each frame's display list
// starts with it.
//
// That rate is the fastest of the last three frames' (each one's retraces, diffframe60), as RT64 guesses a rate from
// the VIs itself (VIHistory::logicalRateFromFactors), not the frame's own. A frame's interpolated frames are drawn
// before the next frame comes, so its rate is a guess at how long it will be on screen, and the frame after a slow one
// comes a VI later as the others do. Told the frame's own, a frame of two VIs among frames of one (a few a second in
// a level) had RT64 plan two VIs of presents and drop half of them when the next frame came, and RT64's pacing, which
// counts those drops as the GPU falling behind and paces to a multiple of the latest rate, held the page at 60
// presents a second or below on a 240 Hz display in both browsers, its tries back up failing within a second
// (N64Recomp-browser's plays.jsonl, set pd-fps). A run of slow frames still reads as their rate.
//
// A tick that would find no controller sample newer than the last tick's while a poll is out is put off, retrace by
// retrace, until the sample comes, for two VIs at most. As the game is, joy_debug_joy (src/lib/joy.c) stops and
// restarts the polling then, which takes two VIs, and the retraces queued meanwhile start the next tick before the
// restarted poll's sample, so it misses too and every frame is two VIs (docs/web.md, Frame rate). The poll that is out
// has its sample at the next VI's joys_handle_retrace, which the scheduler runs before it sends that VI's retrace.
// Retraces already queued come first, two or more where a slow frame started that chain, so the tick is put off past
// each of them, not once (once, the page fell back to 30 for 10-20 s at a time). Polling stopped (a pak's menu) has no
// poll out, and a sample that hasn't come in two VIs is left to the game, which restarts the polling as it would.
// Draining the retraces queued in main_loop instead wouldn't do: the next tick would start at the RDP done of the task
// just submitted, before the next VI, and miss its sample as well.
//
// main_tick is src/lib/main.c's, as the decompilation builds it for ntsc-final (no DEBUG), with those two commands put
// at the start of the frame's display list with the matrix groups after them (patches/origin_interpolation.c), the
// survey's tick before it (patches/shader_survey.c) and the put-off tick.
